Foreman will be holding its usual Foreman Construction Day on Wednesday 6th
February 2019, right after CfgMgmtCamp. Please join us!

The aim is to build upon on the previous 2-4 days of talks and discussions, and
put it to use! We're open to all members of our community, such as

* New users looking for help getting started with Foreman
* Users looking to start contributing
* Code contributors to any of the core projects
* UX design / improvement
* Plugin authors (new or existing plugins)
* Translators / documentors

This is a great opportunity to get (more) involved in the community, and spend
some face-to-face hack time with other Foreman devs. Hope to see you there! 

Please remember to [register](https://registration.cfgmgmtcamp.be/ghent/2019/) through the general Config Management Camp registration system.
