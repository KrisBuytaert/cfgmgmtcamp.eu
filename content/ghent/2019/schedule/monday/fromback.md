Switching out the back bone of your automation tool chain is usually painful.  
It likely involves rewriting all your infrastructure code,
and will either require a scary over-night cut-off, or a period in which two tools run concurrently,
with operators carefully shifting functionality one step at a time.  

With mgmt's support for Puppet code, migrating becomes a lot more natural.  
This session does a deep dive and shows how mgmt will allow you to use and maintain a mixed code base of both Puppet's and mgmt's DSLs.
