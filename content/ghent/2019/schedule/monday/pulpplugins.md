Benefits fueled by the modularity of the pulp plugin ecosystem by taking the example of pulp_deb and pulp_gem.  

Pulp is a rest-api driven, plugin based framework for content repository management.  
Despite being used unmediated, it is also employed as a key backend component in foreman/katello.  
Its complete rewrite, needing a reimplementation of all content plugins, invites for experimentation with new technologies.  
In this talk we introduce the new version of one of those plugins for debian packages, with its unique challenges.  
Also we compare with a completely new one for rubygems.
