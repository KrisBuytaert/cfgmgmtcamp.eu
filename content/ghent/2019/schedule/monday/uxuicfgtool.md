One of Rudder's main focuses is its comprehensive graphical user interface,
which allows users to view and manage its configurations without writing a line of code.  
The user experience and interface considerations for a tool as technical and complex,
and with such potential to break things as a configuration management tool are certainly a challenge,
and in some ways in unchartered territory. Rudder's frontend developer will present an analysis of the situation,
the issues encountered and the approach adopted for the improvement of UX and UI planned for 2019.
