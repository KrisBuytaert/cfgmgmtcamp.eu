Tarmak is an open-source toolkit for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management.  
It is focused on best-practice cluster security, management and operation.  
This talk will clarify the reasoning behind creating Tarmak, the architecture and technologies used.  
With Tarmak we tried to not reinvent the full wheel,
that is why we have chosen to depend on a lot open-source tools (Terraform, Puppet, Vault, ...).  
This talk will explain how all of this is tied together.
