Inspired by Luke Kanies talk last year at CfgMgmtCamp to move from startups to enterprises and
implement what we in the community have learned I have now started that journey at Volvo Cars.  
I will talk about how we within the Consumer Commercial Digital Products are building
a new organization from scratch to help transfer Volvo Cars from a traditional enterprise
to a software company by creating a Devops culture and automate.  
I will also talk about our philosophy for automation and how we are working hard to avoid YAML.
