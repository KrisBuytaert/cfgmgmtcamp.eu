Microservices revolutionized the way we look at app development and is now one of the most popular programming architectures.  
Now, Docker alongside Kubernetes is changing the way teams look at deployments of these microservices.  
Kubernetes provides powerful production-grade orchestration for your "Dockerized" microservices.  
In this workshop, you'll get an overview of Kubernetes, and what it provides for application development.  
You'll then go through the process of building and deploying a microservice application on Kubernetes.  
This is a hands-on-keyboard lab, everyone should come with a laptop and a desire to learn.  
Attendees can use minikube locally, or cloud accounts will be provided.  

We'll cover:

- Kubernetes basics
- Building Container Images
- Deploying the application with Kubernetes
- Upgrading and scaling the application with Kubernetes
- Debugging your application in Kubernetes
