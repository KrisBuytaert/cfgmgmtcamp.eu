JJ works at IBM on the IBM cloud as a Developer Advocate.  
He's focusing on the IBM Kubernetes Service trying to make companies and users have a successful on boarding to the Cloud Native ecosystem.  

He lives and grew up in Austin, Texas.  
He enjoys a good strong stout, hoppy IPA, and some team building Artemis, madding Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld or possibly pair programming cluster Factorio.  
He's a member of the Church of Emacs, though jumps into Vim on remote machines.  
He usually chooses Ubuntu over CentOS, but secretly wants FreeBSD everywhere.  
He's always trying to become a better Ruby developer, but flirts with Go, Rust, and only when he has to, Node.  
A father and husband, if he's not trying to automate his job away he's always to convince his daughters to "be button makers not button pushers".
