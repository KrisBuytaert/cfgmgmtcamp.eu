Lee Briggs is Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Apptio.  
With almost 10 years experience designing, building and maintaining distributed and complex systems,
he wears the scars of many monitoring systems and deployment tools.  

When he's not trying to put monolithic applications in containers, he enjoys playing and watching soccer and walks with family and dog, Toby.
