Who needs some [Ansible](https://ansible.com)? You do! 

You are invited to join your existing, and soon-to-be-new, friends from the Ansible community on Wednesday, 6 February, for a day of learning, sharing, and doing.

Whether you are new to Ansible, a long-time user, or an existing or aspiring contributor -- everyone is welcome. 

Please remember to [register](https://registration.cfgmgmtcamp.be/ghent/2019/) through the general Config Management Camp registration system.

We'll get started around 10:00am with a brief "state of community-land," followed by an overview and discussion of what's coming up next in Ansible-land. 

Following this -- participants, depending on who they are and what they want to do and who shows up, we will have a number of options as a large group or as smaller groups.

 * Need to learn you some Ansible? We can do that! 
 * Deeper dive into contributing -- via code, meetups, reviews, and more!
 * Buddy up with a friend who also has an outstanding PR and lend each other a hand.
 * Bring your conundrums, puzzles, and questions and share with the experts, and maybe get an answer!
 * Get out your feels! Is Ansible making you happy? Are you grumpy with Ansible? Let's discuss.
