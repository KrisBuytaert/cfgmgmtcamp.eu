This presentation show how you can use Ansible to setup a complete datacenter from the metal to a fully functional datacenter.  
The idea is to bootstrap a datacenter from a single laptop and configure all possible components through your configuration management tools.  
In my presentation I will show how to use Ansible to orchestrate as many components of a datacenter as possible, going from baremetal machines,
network switches, to more commonly virtual machines, sdn, sds, and other infrastructure.
