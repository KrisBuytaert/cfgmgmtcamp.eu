Google has been practicing Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) since the early 2000's,
but only recently began speaking about it publicly.  
Some have called SRE 'DevOps 2.0', while others view it as a competing standard.  
This talk discusses the differences and similarities between DevOps and SRE.
