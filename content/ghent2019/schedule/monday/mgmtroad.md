Real-time, autonomous, automation.  

Mgmt is a real-time automation tool that is fast and safe.  
As we get closer to a 0.1 release that we'll recommend as "production ready",
we'll look at the last remaining features that we're aiming to land by then.  
We'll explain and demo the import and module system, classes, and native functions.  

It uses a real-time, reactive programming language to model the desired state over time,
and a powerful event-driven engine to apply this state.  
We'll also show some exciting real-time demos that include scheduling, finite state machines, and remote execution.  
Finally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and
make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.
