Infrastructure as code is a proven pattern,
and so is open source. Wouldn't it make sense to bring a community driven approach to operational code itself?  

This talk is about bringing those ideas together,
to create effective open source communities for operational code on Kubernetes and on traditional machine or cloud environments.  
Collaborating on complex infrastructure, and using open source to share the benefits of that collaboration,
will enable us all to spend more time focused on the things which are truly different about our challenges and less on the problems we all share.
