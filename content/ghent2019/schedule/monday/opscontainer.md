"Docker, Docker, Docker, Docker, ...", developers really love Docker.  
Usually one sees the no longer need for configuration management,
the easy way to spin up a platform on a laptop, the low resource footprint.
But how do you deploy laptops in data centers?  

This talk will give you an insight how we (more Ops then Dev) started to learn (and love) containers,
the issues we saw when running them in larger scale and how Ops people should start dealing with Container technologies.
