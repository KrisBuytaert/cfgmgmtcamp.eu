Pulp is a platform for managing repositories of software packages, and its plugin architecture allows management of any type of content.  
Pulp's web API enables users to synchronize, upload, and publish versioned repositories with simple but flexible workflows.  
This presentation will highlight simplified installation and deployment, better performance, new features,
and a growing collection of plugins including rpm, python, docker, ansible, chef, ruby, file, and more in development.  
Pulp 3 is approaching maturity and is ready for you to test drive.
