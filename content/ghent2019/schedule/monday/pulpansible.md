In this talk, we'll cover the newest Pulp 3 plugin, pulp_ansible.  
Pulp is a platform for managing software packages including RPMs, Python packages, Docker images, and more.  
Users can use the pulp_ansible plugin to mirror Ansible Galaxy content locally, upload and
organize Ansible content in Pulp, and serve content to Ansible clients.  
We'll also talk about how Ansible Galaxy will be using pulp_ansible as its storage engine to store and serve content.
