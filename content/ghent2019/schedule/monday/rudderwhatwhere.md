Rudder is an open source configuration management tool that includes continuous auditing
(with or without remediation), compliance info and graphs and the possibility to configure everything in the UI and/or APIs.  
It has been around for more than six years and has users large (think 10 000 nodes) and small around the world.  

Let's take a moment to look at the vision that lead us here,
how Rudder is different from similar tools, and what users find invaluable, nice (or annoying - I'll be honest!).  
If you're not familiar with Rudder this is a great talk to attend to get the basics covered.
