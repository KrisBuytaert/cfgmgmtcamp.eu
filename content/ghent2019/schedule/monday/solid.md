S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, in the early 2000s.  

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.  
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily re-factor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.  

This talk discusses our options how we can model puppet code while applying the SOLID principles.  
As the puppet DSL is not a object oriented language we will also address the limitations of the design pattern,
which we ll have to solve using the convention over configuration design pattern.
