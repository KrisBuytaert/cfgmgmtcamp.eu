This is a tale from a customer who had a Bash script to talk to the Katello API.  
As tales go, the disaster was coming in form of a Katello upgrade which broke said script and and engineer was called to fix the customers problems.  
The talk will show a few common errors you can make when using bash/cURL as a pseudo API client and
how Python or Ruby with a proper API definition via Swagger or Apipie can prevent these.
