How to manage (large) groups of servers using Foreman and Katello without having to log in.  
Showcases katello-agent, remote execution, openscap, pxe and image based deployments with automated building via Gitlab pipelines.  

I've set up a lab with LXD, Cloud-Init, Foreman Ansible Modules and some more automation to make my life easier.
