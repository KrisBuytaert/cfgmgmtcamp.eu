Istio is a new open platform to connect, manage, and secure micro-services jointly launched by IBM, Google, and Lyft.  
This session will provide a technical overview of the Istio project and demonstrations of using Istio with microservices and Kubernetes.  

Specifically :

Service mesh - what it is, why, and who is using it
Making the deployment more secure (Using istio to get mutual tls authentication between services)
Rolling out a new version to 1% of users (Using istio for traffic splitting)
Making the deployment more robust (Using istio for circuit breaking and automatic request retries)
Controlling the front door (Using Istio-ingressgateway instead of default Kubernetes Ingress)
