What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from development/qa/release background?
- How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles?
- How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management?

I started my first job as an operations engineer 18 months ago and
I had all of those questions and many more.  
Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role and
a DevOps team has been a fascinating journey.  
I'd like to share the lessons I learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.
