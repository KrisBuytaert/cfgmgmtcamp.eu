In this presentation I will show you how to manage Debian/Ubuntu hosts with Katello.  
Last year we at ATIX AG spent a lot of time improving support for Debian-based operating systems.  
With these changes it is possible to fully manage Debian / Ubuntu hosts -
including package installation from content views and managing package updates using Errata.  

Note that we are currently working hard to add changes to the upstream Katello project.  
Therefore some changes are only available as github pull request.
