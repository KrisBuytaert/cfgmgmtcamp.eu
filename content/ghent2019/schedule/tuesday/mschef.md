It's 2019 and at Chef we've been busy building new tools and integrations,
as well as improving our existing open source software with the help of the community.  
This session will get you up to speed on the advances and decisions that have been made
over the last year in the Microsoft, Windows and Azure ecosystem and
give an opportunity to ask questions of our Product/Engineering team.
