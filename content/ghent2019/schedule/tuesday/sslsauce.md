Puppet 6 made a number of changes to the PKI / certificate layer that fix longstanding problems and add awesome new features.  

This will be a technical deep dive into those changes including:

- new intermediate and signing CA support
- improved policy autosigning for cloud auto-scaling
- better revocation and infrastructure crl
- new command line tools
- how to upgrade cleanly and roll new certs without breaking the world

Anyone who's had to troubleshoot Puppet SSL problems will benefit from learning about these improvements.
