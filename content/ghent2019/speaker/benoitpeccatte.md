Benoit Peccatte started out as a developer for air traffic control systems
but quickly became more interested in writing code generators to automate his job.  
After meeting some smart sysadmins on the beach, he switched jobs and has been automating servers for the past decade.  

He stumbled across open source in engineering school,
and quickly became convinced that free software is the only way to keep software maintainable whatever happens in the future.  

Benoit is now trying to automate his job on Rudder, developing features in Rudder to continuously configure and audit more and more servers.
