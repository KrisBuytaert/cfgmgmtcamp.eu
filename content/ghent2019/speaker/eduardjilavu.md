Eduard is a Senior Systems Administrator working for more than 5 years at Booking.com. During the first years he worked on several teams, some of them managing infrastructure for more than a hundred services. Since then, his team built and went through two iterations of Booking.com's container based infrastructure for web services, learning and improving the design each time, adjusting the scope and scale.

Eduard is passionate about open source software, likes to physically hack on things (ranging from wood to arduino), and plays tennis when he has time.
