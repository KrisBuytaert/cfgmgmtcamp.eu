Being an Open Source and unix geek Felix has been in the IT infrastructure service consulting business since the late 1990s.  
Mostly concerned with keeping Open Source solutions up and available he enjoys to fiddle deep down and through the whole stack
yet covering the wholistic aspects of technical infrastructure is what he enjoys the most.  
If not travelling around for IT-related matters or being in front of terminals his usual habitat is being outside either road cycling, running or hiking.
