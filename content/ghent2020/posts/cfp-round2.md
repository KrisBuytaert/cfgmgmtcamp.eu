## CfgMgmtCamp Ghent2020 ##

While some of you may have noticed that the first round of Call-for-Presentation closed and we reopened for round 2.  
We will be starting our review process and already notifying selected speakers, to allow them to have enough time to prepare.  

However, we're looking for _content_, such as __presentations, workshops, fringes__.  
The CfP will run untill __Tuesday 3 December 2019 23:59:59 CET__.  
Please remember to submit soon and often.
