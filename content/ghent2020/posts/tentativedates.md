__CfgMgmtCamp 2020 is a go__.  

The tentative dates are from 3rd to 5th February 2020.  
As previous years, the 3rd and 4th of February will be our main events with the 5th for fringes and workshops.  

We're looking sponsors, talks, workshops, and fringes.
The Call-for-Participation will open soon and an update sponsor document.
