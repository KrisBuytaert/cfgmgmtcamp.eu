There will be __NO__ CfgMgmtCamp 2021.  
As the world continues in lockdown due to COVID-19.  
The future remains uncertain and we have decided not to organize CfgMgmtCamp Ghent 2021.  
Over the past 6 years, we've had 9 events and we have seen CfgMgmtCamp grow from a few 100 participants to more then 750 participants.  
The event is made for interaction and we cannot organize that safely with the current situation.  
We also believe that we cannot replicate the community interaction, we have virtually,
and so we are _not going for a virtual event_ either.  


And while we all are sad that we need to make this decission, we hope everyone remains safe and healthy.
