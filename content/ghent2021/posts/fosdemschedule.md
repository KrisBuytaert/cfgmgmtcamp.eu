This is the draft schedule for __Saturday 6 February 2020__ all times are in _local FOSDEM time_ also know as __CET__ or __UTC+1__.  

As this is the very first FOSDEM Virtual, we'll keep you updated on the practicals of the event once the FOSDEM teams confirmes the process.
We want this to be as interactive as possible, so there will be a Q&A, and other talking possibilities.
