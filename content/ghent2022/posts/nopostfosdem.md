While we were very hopeful and started our preparations,
we have decided __not__ to hold CfgMgmtCamp after FOSDEM 2022.  

With the new wave of COVID19 hitting the world yet again and
Europe going again in lockdowns, we cannot plan ahead.
The rules keep changing, venues are confused on how to plan,
and we have entered yet again a period of uncertainty.  

We are keeping an option of doing something in late 2022.
We are hopeful, however we are not making any promises.
