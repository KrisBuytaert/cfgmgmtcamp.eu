Everyone who has been using Puppet with a self-signed CA for over 5 years knows that dreaded time: the time when the CA 
and client certificates must be renewed.

This talk will present the ways to ease CA renewal, and present a new approach to renew Puppet client certificates in a 
secure and automated way.
