Jerakia is standalone tool inspired by Puppet's Hiera which allows you to separate configuration data from configuration code.  
The newest iteration of Jerakia provides you a smooth integration into Ansible via a module.  
This talk will give a generic overview over Jerakia and it's intentions as well as the integration into Ansible.
