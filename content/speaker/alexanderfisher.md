Alex works as a freelance Linux infrastruture engineer in the South West of England.
He has been specialising in helping companies with their Puppet and Foreman adoption for over 4 years.
Soon he'll start a new project helping a company migrate from Puppet 2.8, (and might talk about those challenges next year)!
Recently reelected to serve on the Vox Pupuli Project Management Committee, he's looking forward to helping more people become involved with the fantastic community we have got.
