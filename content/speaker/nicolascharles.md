Nicolas is a co-founder of Rudder, he supports customers and users in the complex deployments of Rudder, both from an organizational and technical point of view. Technically, he intervenes in particular on the scalability and performance aspects of the solution, as well as on the interconnection between the policy engine and the agent.

Before founding Rudder, Nicolas explored many fields as a developer and integrator, from very low level hardware (hard disk emulation in FPGA) to neural networks.

In his spare time, Nicolas is a happy but sometimes tired father, a former Salsa dancer, and an alternative music lover.
